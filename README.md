# Daily Deals

Daily Deals is an application built with Angular 2 that shows how you can add token based authentication to your Angular 2 applications. 

# Running the App

You will need to run both the Node.js server located in the `server` directory and Angular 2 front-end located in the `ng2auth` directory. See each of the project directories for detailed instructions on how to run the projects. You will need an Auth0 account, so if you don't already have one, [sign up](https://auth0.com/signup) for a free account today.
